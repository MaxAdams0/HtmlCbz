# HtmlCbz
A html/js in-browser .cbz comic/manga file viewer<br>
Mainly intended for use in school/work where apps and other websites are probably blocked, but use it however you'd like!

## How to use
- Go to [https://maxadams0.github.io/HtmlCbz](https://maxadams0.github.io/HtmlCbz)
- Go to [https://htmlcbz.pages.dev/](https://htmlcbz.pages.dev/)
- Run it through browser ( just open index.html )
- By using the Google Docs feature 'Apps Script' ( follow instructions below )

## How to create Google Docs deployment using Apps Script
### 7 steps but they're not hard, promise

> 1. Create a new doc
> 2. Go to `Extensions -> Apps Script` (it will open a new tab)
> 3. Under the `Files` section, there should be a `Code.gs` file
> 4. Make 1 other files named `Index.html` (make sure the first letter is capitalized)
> 5. In Github, Copy all of `Code.gs` and `index.html` into the files you made in Apps Script
> 6. Go back to the Google Doc and refresh
> 7. If a new menu tab should appear called `Cbz Reader`, you're good to go! Have fun avoiding classwork!
